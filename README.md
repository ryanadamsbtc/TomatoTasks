TomatoTasks
=========

A tiny solo project: a simple CLI-first Pomodoro timer with lightweight task notes. No external services, just a few scripts and a text-based workflow.

Goals
- Track tasks with short notes
- Start/stop Pomodoro sessions
- Persist data to a local JSON file under `.tomatotasks/`

Usage (planned)
- `python -m tomatotasks add "Write blog outline"`
- `python -m tomatotasks ls`
- `python -m tomatotasks start 25` (minutes)
- `python -m tomatotasks stop`

Roadmap
- Basic CLI scaffold
- JSON storage
- Pomodoro session tracking
- Optional TUI later if time

Notes
- This is a personal nights-and-weekends project.
- Iâ€™ll keep commits small and pragmatic.
- Real usage examples will evolve as the CLI settles.
